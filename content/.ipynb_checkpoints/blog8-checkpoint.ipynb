    "What is a python class? Before answering this question it might be useful to go over few definitions and concept to help with better understanding what python class is and why it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to define a programming object. What is an Object? In programming, basic elements of programs are called objects. In Python, strings, dictionaries, integers, lists and functions are all objects.This means they have certain things in common.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we go over procedural programming concept. Dividing a program into reusable chunks called procedures of functions. This maintains separation between the code and data and also makes it easier to visualize what the code is doing and to maintain the code. Another important function of procedural programming is to avoid repetition which makes programming a lot faster and efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third concept is object oriented programming. Lots of operations are common to objects of the same type\n",
    "For example, in python string is an object. Standard operations on strings may include making a lowercase or uppercase version of a string or splitting it. Properties of objects in python are called methods. So, we can call\n",
    "In Python there is a blueprint string object called the string type. Its actual name is str. \n",
    "In an object oriented language we can build these in as properties of the string object. \n",
    "It has all the methods and properties associated with the string. Every time a new string is created, the blueprint is used to create a new object with all the properties of the blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we get to define a python class. Whenever we create our own blueprints, these are called classes. \n",
    "We can define our own class of object and from this create as many instances of this class as we want. \n",
    "They will all have the methods (and other properties) from the blueprint - the class.\n",
    "Here we create a python class named Car.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "class Car(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, wheels= 4):\n",
    "        self.wheels= wheels\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def price(self): #calculating the price of the car\n",
    "        pr = self.wheels *4000\n",
    "        print (\"The price of this car is: $%s\"%pr )\n",
    "\n",
    "Mustang = Car()\n",
    "print Mustang.wheels\n",
    "4\n",
    "print Mustang.price()\n",
    "The price of this car is: $16000\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "the self is referring to its own function or variables and is used to attach functions and variables to a class. The initialization or constructor (__init__) is a function that is called when the class is created and do all the setup work. For example default values for wheels in Car class is set to be 4 but it as optional input. You can define the number of wheels when you initiate an instace of this class. In above example we initiated an instance of Car class called Mustang. By defualt, it has 4 wheels. If you apply the method of price on Mustang car you get the value of 16000 as its price since the function price is defined in the car class the multiplies the number of wheels by 4000. \n",
    "In case you want to define another number of wheels for your car you can add it as an input like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "GMC = Car(wheels =6)\n",
    "print GMC.wheels\n",
    "6\n",
    "GMC.price()\n",
    "The price of this car is: $24000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes can inherit data and properties from their parent class. For example the car class above can be a child of Vehicle class and can have properties in addition to the properties it inherited from vehicle class in a following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "class Vehicle(object):\n",
    "    base_sale_price = 0\n",
    "    def __init__(self, wheels):\n",
    "        self.wheels = wheels\n",
    "    def price(self):\n",
    "        pr = self.base_sale_price * self.wheels\n",
    "        print (\"The price of this car is: $%s\"%pr )\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, wheels=4):\n",
    "        self.wheels = wheels\n",
    "        self.base_sale_price = 4000\n",
    "\n",
    "GMC = Car(6)\n",
    "6\n",
    "GMC.price()\n",
    "The price of this car is: $24000\n",
    "```\n"
